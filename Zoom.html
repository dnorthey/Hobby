    <h2 class="lockdown"> Day in lockdown: dunno</h2> 


<p>With the vast majority of people now falling into a routine of working from home, technologies enabling collaboration are coming to the forefront of business, and social, conversations. For some, working remotely isn't new at all, utilising tools such as MS Teams and Skype regularly. However, a significant proportion of employees and business have been forced into updating their tech in an attempt to replicate normalcy. With this flood in demand for reliable and collaborative remote working comes a new champion in video conferencing: Zoom. 
 
     <br><br>

     Zoom, founded in 2011, provides an unparalled video conferencing experience, so much so that virtual pub quizzes are being hosted between friends across the platform, proving the technology is a hit not only for businesses but also for those wanting to break the barriers to social interaction which a lockdown presents. 

     <br><br>
     However, Zoom's data security strategy has recently come under heavy scrutiny. With almost 600,000 app downloads on 15th March alone, many have been left questioning whether Zoom's security protections can keep up with the increase in demand. Indeed, the New York attorney general, Letitia James, sent a letter to Zoom detailing concerns about the company's security practices and inquiring if any new security measures had been put in place since the spike in demand. The letter, obtained by The New York Times, comes after a number of notable security failures being reported online by users. A phrase being coined online is 'Zoombombing' which has been used to express incidents such as hijackers entering Zoom meetings to post white supremacist messages on an educational webinar about anti-Semitism. Since the start of 2020, more than 1,700 new fake Zoom domains were registered with 25 percent of them being registered in the last week of March. This is telling, as cyber criminals set up fake Zoom domains and encourage users to enter their account credentials into their domain, giving access to the criminals to enter conference meetings.
 
     <br><br>

     An extract from the New York Attorney general's office letter read as: 'Zoom’s existing security practices might not be sufficient to adapt to the recent and sudden surge in both the volume and sensitivity of data being passed through its network,'… 'While Zoom has remediated specific reported security vulnerabilities, we would like to understand whether Zoom has undertaken a broader review of its security practices.'
<br>
It has also been revealed that not only are Zoom's security measures under pressure but so are its privacy standards. A Motherboard report revealed that Zoom's iOS app was sharing user device data with Facebook, a process that was not outlined clearly in Zoom's privacy policy. Since the report was released, Zoom has updated its iOS app to ensure that this data sharing no longer occurs. 

     <br><br>
     In response to the inquiry from the New York attorney general, Zoom told the BBC that:
     <br>
     'Zoom takes its users' privacy, security, and trust extremely seriously.'…'During the Covid-19 pandemic, we are working around-the-clock to ensure that hospitals, universities, schools, and other businesses across the world can stay connected and operational. We appreciate the New York Attorney General's engagement on these issues and are happy to provide her with the requested information.'
<br><br>
There is no doubt that Zoom has pushed the boundaries of what we as users as well as companies expect from video conferencing. From Boris Johnson using the technology for the first ever digital cabinet meeting to friends keeping in touch, Zoom's successes are undeniable. However, in this current climate and with huge increases in demand it must ensure that its security practices remain up to the challenge, whilst providing clarity and transparency over how it handles user data.
