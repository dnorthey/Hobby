    <p>In my never ending quest for easy one pot meals that utilise random items which haven't been purged in the mad
     dash to hoard gargantuan amounts of food, I satisfyingly discovered / created / stole this recipe for a sausage
     and bean stew. 
</p>
     <br>
    <b>Ingredients:</b> 
    
</p>

<ul class="mainbullet">

<li>Sausages - any variety or quantity will do here, whichever satisfies your desire for sausage.
<ul class="sub1">
    <li>PRO TIP - reckon chorizo sausage would be banging in here but I unfortunately only had the basic 
        50% pork/50% sawdust option available.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Beans - chickpeas, cannelloni, broad beans (400g).</li>
<li>Brown onion.</li>
<li>Garlic. As much as desired.</li>
<li>Salt and pepper (to taste).</li>
<li>Disgusting amounts of paprika. If you think you've used enough - put more in.</li>
<li>Any veg you have on offer, I used: </li>
<ul class="sub2">
<li>Peppers.</li>
<li>Frozen pack veg (contains peas, green beans, sweetcorn).</li>
<li>Cauliflower.</li>
<li>I may have put tomatoes in there, but for the life of me I cannot recall.</li>
</ul>
</ul>


<b>Method:</b>

<p>Now I must admit, I didn’t quite make this 'one' pot. In fact, it was two. Sue me. I chucked the sausages in the 
    oven whilst cracking on with my pot of veg. However, you could arguably put the sausages in the one pot, I would
     put these in at the beginning and let sizzle on a medium/low heat, lid on. 
     <br><br>

     But I'm not doing that so in the 
     oven they go at 180* fan, jiggling them around every 5 minutes or so, don't want these sawdust laden bad boys 
     sticking to the pan. Also, you should probably chop your veg, might help. 
     <br><br>
     Anyway - HOB ACTION - get your best 
     large pan and pour a load of oil in there. Get your garlic, chuck it in. Let simmer. Then, get all your veg, 
     chuck it in. Followed by salt, pepper and paprika. It really is best that you lather this mixture in paprika, 
     honestly it really is best. Pop a lid on that huni and put on a low heat, stirring occasionally. 
     <br><br>

     Just before 
     the sausages are ready, crack open that can of legumes you got waiting in the wings, drain it slightly but we 
     want to keep some of those legume juices so this stew can get moist (sorry). Let the legumes and legume juice 
     cook for a few mins (kind of depends on what legumes you’ve used, use your own initiative I'm just one man). 
     <br><br>Remove the sausages from the oven and drop straight into the pot, hopefully resulting in a bit of splashback, 
     yum. That's about it tbh, you're good to go. This would be healthy if not for the copious amounts of oil and 
     sawdust which go into such a recipe. Add cheese maybe?  
</p>


<p class="lol">
    BUT WAIT 
</p>

<p>
    Those of you who aren't blind will see from the photo that there are cookies next to the stew! Well I didn't make those so look up your own recipe. Maybe one day cookies will make it on here.
