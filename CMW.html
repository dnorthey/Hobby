<p>A good friend of mine reminded me of simpler, freer times BC (before corona). Back in June of 2019, when one was allowed on the tube and into work, myself and my dear friend (let us call him Chad) Chad were in charge of a charity week in the office. This week was intended to bring joy and happiness whilst also raising money for good causes. Unfortunately, most people in offices are actually incredibly dull and void of any creative flair, I include myself in this. So we decided to keep it simple and target the one thing that unites humanity across earth: food. Not just any food, straight up pizza. The plan was to stock up on pizza and run round the office with a trolley asking people to pay 50p for a slice, of which all proceeds would go to charity. 
 
 
     <br><br>

     After scouring the nearby area for anywhere that may do a reasonable office delivery deal, such did our budget allow, we settled on that well known Italian delicatessen, Greggs. This actually turned out to be a bit of a masterstroke as Chad rightly pointed out, we're all about inclusivity and Greggs had just released their vegan sausage roll. Namaste. 


     <br><br>
     Next step was sourcing, easy job it seemed. Well, it would've be an easy job if I wasn't at the helm, ha! Oh. We soldiered on down to Greggs to put our order in for later in the week. I addressed the Greggs man with our situation and detailed our plans for pizza use. However, like all things in life you should always be vague detailing plans and when asked, lie. Just in case. Unfortunately I was not vague, I was extensively detailed. Apparently there is some non-descript Greggs regulation which prohibits Greggs from selling you pizza if you intend to sell that pizza on. Problemo. But this Greggs man being an absolute CHAP, told us that if we went to the Greggs round the corner and put in the same order, this time shutting the fuck up about our plans, the round the corner Greggs man would sell us all the pizza we so desired. This is thus what we did and our success was prevalent.

     There's not much to say other than trolleying pizza round the office with my good mate Chad was top 5 best days in an office I've ever had. And we managed to make a profit. Obviously all sent to charity. Only thing left to say is big up Greggs and that the vegan sausage roll is pretty banging, very salty but I imagine that comes from the sawdust.
